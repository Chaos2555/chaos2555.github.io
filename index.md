## 📊 How It Works
bullet-mcp uses cognitive science research to evaluate your bullet points. It takes into account the following:

- **Miller's Law:** This principle suggests that most people can only hold 7 (plus or minus 2) items in their working memory. The application helps you refine your list to meet this guideline.
  
- **Serial Position Effects:** This concept indicates that items at the beginning and end of a list are remembered better than those in the middle. The tool helps you position your points for maximum impact.

By entering your bullet points, you get a score and specific suggestions on how to enhance clarity and engagement.
